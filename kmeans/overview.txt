K-mean Clustering

K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm
Clustering data points into K-groups based on similarity


# How it works

1. Choose K
    K = number of clusters
    K = 3 divide the data into three clusters

2. Init Centroids
    Randomly select K points as initial cluster centers (centroids)

3. Assign Points to Nearest Centroid
    For each data point: compute the distance to each centroid
    Assign the point to the cluster with nearest centroid

4. Recalculate Centroids
    Compute the new centroid for each cluster
    By taking the mean of all points assigned to that cluster

5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until convergence
    Continue updating clusters until centroids stop changing
    Or met a stopping criterion like max number of iterations met
